**gödel** is a build tool for Go projects. gödel streamlines the process of setting up, formatting, checking, testing,
building, distributing and publishing Go projects. The main goal of the tool is to eliminate boilerplate code and
scripts that are often required for full-fledged Go projects and to provide a consistent development experience on a
project across different machines and developers.

The [tutorial](https://github.com/palantir/godel/wiki/Tutorial) provides a full walk-through of setting up configuring
gödel on an example project.
