Update projects using pre-2.0 version of gödel
----------------------------------------------
Projects that use a pre-2.0 version of gödel can be updated to use the latest version of gödel using the `godelinit`
program. As an exmaple, we will update the version of gödel used by `github.com/nmiyake/echgo` (which was the tutorial
project for the 1.x release of gödel) to use the latest version.

Start by getting the repository and switching to it:

```
➜ go get github.com/nmiyake/echgo
➜ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/nmiyake/echgo
```

Run `./godelw version` to verify that the version of gödel used by the project is pre-1.0:

```
➜ ./godelw version
Downloading https://palantir.bintray.com/releases/com/palantir/godel/godel/0.27.0/godel-0.27.0.tgz to /root/.godel/downloads/godel-0.27.0.tgz...
godel version 0.27.0
```

The godelinit program can be used to install or update gödel. Although it is technically possible to use the
`./godelw update` mechanism to get the new binary, pre-2.0 versions of gödel do not know about configuration upgrades,
so running `./godelw update` will only update the gödel version. Using godelinit has the advantage that it knows to
invoke the commands to upgrade the configuration after gödel itself has been updated.

First, ensure that the latest version of godelinit is installed:

```
➜ go get -u github.com/palantir/godel/godelinit
```

Then, run `godelinit`. Running the program with no arguments determines the latest released version of gödel and either
installs it or upgrades the version of gödel in the current project to that version. In this case, because the newest
version of gödel is >=2 and the version of gödel in the current project is <2, the legacy configuration will be
upgraded:

```
➜ godelinit
Upgraded configuration for godel.yml
Upgraded configuration for dist-plugin.yml
Upgraded configuration for license-plugin.yml
Upgraded configuration for format-plugin.yml
Upgraded configuration for test-plugin.yml
Upgraded configuration for check-plugin.yml
WARNING: The following configuration file(s) were non-empty and had no known upgraders for legacy configuration: [generate.yml]
         If these configuration file(s) are for plugins, add the plugins to the configuration and rerun the upgrade task.
```

As indicated by the output, most of the configuration is automatically upgraded. Verify that this is the case:

```
➜ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	deleted:    godel/config/check.yml
	deleted:    godel/config/dist.yml
	deleted:    godel/config/exclude.yml
	deleted:    godel/config/format.yml
	modified:   godel/config/godel.properties
	deleted:    godel/config/imports.yml
	deleted:    godel/config/license.yml
	deleted:    godel/config/test.yml
	modified:   godelw

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	godel/config/check-plugin.yml
	godel/config/dist-plugin.yml
	godel/config/format-plugin.yml
	godel/config/godel.yml
	godel/config/license-plugin.yml
	godel/config/test-plugin.yml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

However, note that the output said that `generate.yml` was non-empty but there were no known upgraders for it. This is
because, although `generate` was a builtin task prior to gödel 2.0, starting with gödel 2.0 this task is provided by a
plugin. We can upgrade the configuration by adding the plugin and explicitly running the `upgrade-config` task with the
`--legacy` flag set. Start by updating the `godel.yml` configuration to add the plugin:

```
➜ echo 'plugins:
  resolvers:
    - "https://palantir.bintray.com/releases/{{GroupPath}}/{{Product}}/{{Version}}/{{Product}}-{{Version}}-{{OS}}-{{Arch}}.tgz"
  plugins:
    - locator:
        id: "com.palantir.go-generate:generate-plugin:1.0.0-rc3"
exclude:
  names:
    - "\\\\..+"
    - "vendor"
    - ".+_string.go"
  paths:
    - "godel"' > godel/config/godel.yml
```

Now that the plugin has been added to the configuration, run the `upgrade-config` task in legacy mode:

```
➜ ./godelw upgrade-config --legacy
Upgraded configuration for generate-plugin.yml
```

The message indicates that the configuration was upgraded. You can verify this by observing that a `generate-plugin.yml`
file is now present in the configuration directory:

```
➜ cat godel/config/generate-plugin.yml
generators:
  stringer:
    go-generate-dir: generator
    gen-paths:
      paths:
      - echo/type_string.go
```

Run the verify task to verify that the upgraded configuration is working correctly:

```

Although all of the checks pass, one of the tests now fails. This is because the integration test uses the
`github.com/palantir/godel/pkg/products`. This package had an API-breaking change: projects that use version 2 or later
of gödel that use this package must use the v2 version of the package instead. In order to fix this, vendor the v2
package and update the test to use it:

```
➜ cp -r ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/palantir/godel/pkg/products/v2/ vendor/github.com/palantir/godel/pkg/products/
➜ sed -i 's:github.com/palantir/godel/pkg/products:github.com/palantir/godel/pkg/products/v2/products:g' integration_test/integration_test.go
```

Confirm that the "verify" task now succeeds:

```

----
### Update to a specific version
The `--version` flag can be used to upgrade gödel to a specific version.

### Provide a checksum
The `--checksum` flag can be used to specify the expected checksum for the update.

### Sync installation to contents of `godel/config/godel.properties`
The `--sync` flag can be used to specify that the update operation should update gödel to match the values specified
in the `godel/config/godel.properties` file. The file should be edited to match the desired state first.

Updating gödel in this manner requires knowing the distribution URL for the target version. Although it is optional, it
is recommended to have the SHA-256 checksum of the distribution as well to ensure the integrity of the update.
