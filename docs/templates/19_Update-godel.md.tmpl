Update gödel
------------
The version of gödel used by a project can be updated by running the `./godelw update` command.

The `./godelw update` operation compares the project's current version of gödel with the latest released version
according to GitHub. The query for the latest release is performed at most once per hour by default. The
`--cache-duration` flag can be used to modify this. If the current version does not match the latest version, it
downloads the latest version and updates the files in the project as necessary.

Updating gödel will typically update the `godelw` wrapper file and may add new configuration files to the `godel/config`
directory. Updating gödel will also run the `upgrade-configuration` command, which will upgrade the configuration for
all of the loaded plugins if necessary. Any files that are updated are always backed up first.

Currently, the tutorial uses the latest available version, so the `update` task has no effect.

The `godelw` wrapper ensures that the required version of gödel is present on the system (downloading it if necessary)
on every invocation, so when other developers (or the CI system) checks out a version of the project that updates the
version of gödel that is used, the first `./godelw` command they invoke will ensure that the updated version is
available. This ensures that all gödel operations are always using the correct version of the program.

### Update to a specific version
The `--version` flag can be used to upgrade gödel to a specific version.

### Provide a checksum
The `--checksum` flag can be used to specify the expected checksum for the update.

### Sync installation to contents of `godel/config/godel.properties`
The `--sync` flag can be used to specify that the update operation should update gödel to match the values specified
in the `godel/config/godel.properties` file. The file should be edited to match the desired state first.

Updating gödel in this manner requires knowing the distribution URL for the target version. Although it is optional, it
is recommended to have the SHA-256 checksum of the distribution as well to ensure the integrity of the update.
