  description: |-
    Fixes issue where godel could fail if multiple instances were performing plugin and/or asset resolution at the same time. Note that, in order for this fix to work, all of the copies of godel that are running concurrently must have this fix.

    Introduces a new "godel-resolver.lock" file in the godel plugins
    directory that must be locked while plugin and asset resolution
    is performed.
